  PARAMETERS:
  
    a. population_size: Size of population to be genrated (ex. 1000, 10000...). Default is 1000
    
    b. csv_output_file_path: full path to all generated data in CSV indicated file. Default is output.csv
    
    c. generate_graphs: 1 (generate all graphs) or 0 otherwise. Default is 1
    
    d: polynomial_degree: 2 (Linear polynomial regession degree, starting from 2). Default set to 2
    
    e. show_graphs: 1 to show graphs, anything else if not. Default set to 1
    
    f. graphs_folder_name: folder path name where generated graphics will be saved
